# The lines containig data have simple 'key = value' format.
# If some information is missing the default value for this parameter is assumed.

# The numbers can be written as well in scientific as in normal notation.

# Data type (default: normal)
# Possible values are 'average' and 'time-frequency'. Please note that they are still not supported.

# This value can be overwritten for single channels (see below)

# Recording start time
# This time is represented with one of the two format strings:

# Channel unit (if it differs from the one set with DataUnit).
# These values overwrite the conversion specified via the DataUnit parameter.
# Note that the dashes (-) will be interpreted
# as a separator between the active and reference channel names.
# This means that the channel names are not allowed to contain dashes.
