Package: filespec
============


A simple wrapper around the core [Perl][perl] module [File::Spec][file-spec].
Addmittedly this is an extremely simple wrapper but it might be handy for 
some people that want to perform tasks such as translating between relative
and absolute path names, accross multiple operating systems. The scripts 
included here use the version of Perl that is shipped in with all modern 
versions of MATLAB. 

The scripts are organized within a [MATLAB package][matlab-pkg]. 
MATLAB packages are a nice way of keeping your scripts organized, but it is
a relatively new feature of MATLAB, which means that you may not be able to
run the scripts if you are using an outdated version of MATLAB.

## Installation

To install, simply place the folder `+filespec` somewhere in your 
hard-drive, say in `C:/mylocation`. As a result you should have all 
the scripts and this documentation located in `C:/mylocation/+filespec`. 
Finally, add folder `C:/mylocation` to your MATLAB path. 


## The filespec package

All scripts are contained within a package called `filespec`, which means
that for running the scripts you will have to either import the package 
(using MATLAB's [import][matlab-import] command) or specify the package
name when calling a specific script. That is, the following code:

[matlab-import]: http://www.mathworks.nl/help/techdoc/ref/import.html

    myRelPath = '../tmp/./../somefolder';
    myAbsPath = filespec.rel2abs(myRelPath);

is equivalent to this code:

    myRelPath = '../tmp/./../somefolder';
    import filespec.rel2abs;
    myAbsPath = rel2abs(myRelPath);

Alternatively you can simply import the whole package whenever you want to 
use any of the scripts using:

    import filespec.*;

## Features

The most useful feature of this package is the ability to translate 
between absolute and relative paths:

    import filespec.*;
    myRelPath  = '../tmp/./../somefolder';
    myAbsPath  = rel2abs(myRelPath);
    myRelPath2 = abs2rel(myAbsPath);


Note that in OSes that support symlinks (e.g. Unix) the commands above does *not* 
collapse x/../y sections into y. This is by design. If /foo on your
system is a symlink to /bar/baz, then /foo/../quux is actually /bar/quux,
 not /quux as a naive ../-removal would give you. For more information, 
read the help of each script or refer to the documentation of the Perl
module [File::Spec][file-spec].
