SPHERTEST Sphericity tests menu. It would means that all the p-axis have the
same variability or eigenvalues. Tests are related to the Correlation (R)
or Covariance (S) matrix.

Usage

1. It is necessary you have defined on Matlab the X - data matrix. Size of matrix (X)
must be n-by-p; n=observations, p-independent variables=columns. 

2. For running this file it is necessary to call the sphertest function as sphertest(X,alpha)
(alpha-significance level default = 0.05). Please see the help sphertest.

3. Immediately it will ask you by directed arguments which is your 
sphericity test of interest.

4. Once you input your choices, it will appears your results.
