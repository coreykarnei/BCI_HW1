#The Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox

The Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT) is an open source Matlab toolbox for the computation and integration of neurophysiological biomarkers. NBT offers a pipeline from data storage to statistics including artefact rejection, signal visualization, biomarker computation, and statistical testing. NBT allows for easy implementation of new biomarkers, and incorporates an online wiki (http://www.nbtwiki.net) that facilitates collaboration among NBT users including extensive help and tutorials. The standardised way of data storage and analysis that NBT proposes will allow different research projects to merge, compare or share their data and biomarker algorithms.

Currently (November 2015) the NBT toolbox has more than 1200 users, and has been downloaded more than 3.000 times.  

The Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox is developed by the Neuronal Oscillations and Cognition Group at the CNCR with partial funding from the Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam.
Main development team: Simon-Shlomo Poil, Sonja Simpraga, Richard Hardstone, Klaus Linkenkaer-Hansen. 
Previous member of the development team: Rick Jansen, Giuseppina Schiavone
